I created a new Windows 10 Virtual Machine with Microsoft Azure
I installed Jenkins on Virtual Machine and opened a Git Hub repository
I opened jenkins using local host with server 8080
I used Visual Studio to write a simple python code
I used GitBash on my local machine to push code to Git hub
I created a New Job on Jenkins and used the URL of the repository to integrate the repository to Git Hub
I created a build on Jenkins that checks if there are any changes to my code. This is scheduled to run every minute.
I ensured that my Jenkins is available on Port 8080 so that it can be accessed by She Code Africa
